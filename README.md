## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My plan was to use this project as another gimme (like my last project [github.com/ClaytonDewey/fem-social-links-profile](https://github.com/ClaytonDewey/fem-social-links-profile)). Styling the lists to match the design proved to be a little trickier than I had anticipated.

### Continued development

I think I need to work on my CSS for ordered/unordered lists as well as tables. I don't use them all that much, and anything beyond basic styles make me Google a lot more than I would like

### Useful resources

These two pages were awesome for helping figure out styling ul/ol components.

- [Styling Ordered Lists with CSS Counters](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/styling-ordered-lists-with-css-counters/)
- [Gradient Ordered List](https://codepen.io/erinesullivan/pen/qGrdGV)
